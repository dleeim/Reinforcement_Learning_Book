# Reinforcement_Learning_Projects
The repository is for codes for Reinforcement Learning studied during my 2nd year Summer Break

Content:
1. Q-Learning on a grid world problem
2. Dynamic programming to replicate the results of grid world problem in the textbook "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S Sutton. The result was used during my presentation of chapter 4 Dynamic Programming during RL Book Club (Recording of my prsentation: https://youtu.be/LcxECYjn-Dk)
4. Off-Policy Monte Carlo Method to reach to desired water level in water tank (finite horizon)
5. Reinforce (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient) using Pytorch to reach to desired water level in water tank (finite horizon)
